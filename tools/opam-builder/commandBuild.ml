this case, some other packages will be skipped because of that
failure.  However, opam-builder might later detect it, and restart a
finally successful build for the initial package, but unfortunately,
since the dependencies have not changed, the other packages will not
be rebuilt and keep believing that there is still a problem.

Here, we try to detect this case, and restart the build (only once)
after deleting the wrong result files. *)
